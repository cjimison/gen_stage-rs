# Work in Progress

The actor base model is really a wonderful system when dealing with concurrent execution models.  This is especially true when dealing with servers where you are not trying to break up a single problem, but really you are just trying to run the same logic for a bunch of users.  That said it is become very easy to overload a server when you just processing requests with really thinking about the state of your system.  This library is a Rust inspired port of the wonderful GenStage libary written in Elixir.
